# Task Manager

This project implements a task manager application that allows users to manage various tasks and processes. The program provides functionalities such as adding tasks, displaying tasks, sorting tasks (FCFS and SJF algorithms), marking tasks as completed, killing tasks, displaying task details, showing all processes, and showing network usage.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add tasks with details such as name, priority, burst time, memory usage, CPU usage, duration, and network usage.
- **Display Tasks**: Users can display all added tasks with their details.
- **Sort Tasks**: Tasks can be sorted using the First Come First Serve (FCFS) or Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithms.
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **Kill Task**: Users can kill tasks.
- **Display Task Details**: Users can display details of a specific task.
- **Show All Processes**: Users can view all running processes.
- **Show Network Usage**: Users can view the total network usage of all tasks.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Choose options from the menu to perform various tasks.

## Additional Notes

- The program uses a doubly linked list to store tasks.
- Tasks can be added with specific details, and programs can be launched directly from the task manager.
- Sorting algorithms like FCFS and SJF are implemented to sort tasks based on their burst time and priority.
- The program provides functionality to mark tasks as completed and kill tasks by name.
- Users can view the details of a specific task, including name, priority, burst time, memory usage, and CPU usage.
- The program also allows users to view all running processes and the total network usage of all tasks.

Feel free to explore and modify the program according to your requirements!
